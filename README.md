# cutoff-phenomenon

I worked with other students on the cut-off phenomenon for random walks on finite groups. This research project was monitored by Romain Tessera. We summarized our work in the following handout (still under construction):

This notebook aims at illustrating an example where there is no cut-off: the simple random walk on the finite cyclic group of order d (d odd and greater than 6). A proof using representation theory can be found in the handout.
